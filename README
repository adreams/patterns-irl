Overview
========

The purpose of this project is to give good examples of design/architectural
patterns. The reason for this is that most examples you can find for 
patterns are hypothetical, bad or plain wrong - so this is just a collection
of good examples.

This is a reference for books/articles/lecturers/students so that each
example you use would be good, from real life and understandable.

You can use the examples any way you like on the condition that if you improve,
implement code or do a diagram then publish them for free or send them to me
so that these can be incorporated here - so they must be usable under
CC [by-sa]. You will be also mentioned in the contributors list.

This also means only for that example - so if you are writing a book then
you don't have to give away the whole thing for free.

For each pattern we try to give these points::

    Short, concise and to the point summary of the pattern
    Overview of the patterns
    Abstract diagram of the design pattern
    Examples
        principle
        example of bad design
        example improved with pattern
    Tips
    Warnings
    List of source codes where this pattern has been used

Each example must be from a real life scenario and it must be
totally clear that using this pattern improves the code.

Improving code means that it improves the model as well as code.
So if the model becomes complex and code simple then that example
shouldn't be here.

You can contact me by email "egonelbre+pirl" and add to that

in spam folder.

Things I'm looking for:

* examples (any language)
* criticism
* whether some example is hard to understand why it makes code better
* improvements
* models, diagrams
