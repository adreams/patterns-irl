Overview
^^^^^^^^

The concept of factory means that you won't call the objects
constructor directly instead you'll call some method attached
to the object being created or a separate class that creates the
object.

This means you can do more complicated object postprocessing
after creating. This is either because you don't want to extend
the class or you want to separate the specialized handling or
you can't add it to the class.

Instead of calling the constructor of a class directly
you use a method instead. This means that your creation of
object and setting the properties easily modified without
modifying the original class.

Examples

Avoid inheritance
.................

Avoiding useless inheritance and code duplication::

    Factory.createBlueButton() -> a button colored blue
    Factory.createRedButton()  -> a button colored red

Information containment
.......................

Information containment::

    Database.createSocket() -> socket with appropriate variables taken
                               from database object

Lifetime management
...................

Lifetime management of created objects::

    WindowManager.createWindow() -> Window, adds window to self
    WindowManager.MinimizeAll()  -> calls minimize for each window

Avoid object duplication
........................

Avoiding duplicate object creation::

    ResourceManager.createResource("somefile.jpg") -> FileX
    ResourceManager.createResource("somefile.jpg") -> FileX
